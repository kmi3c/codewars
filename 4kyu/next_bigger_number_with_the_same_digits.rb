# You have to create a function that takes a positive integer number and returns
# the next bigger number formed by the same digits:
# nextBigger(12)==21
# nextBigger(513)==531
# nextBigger(2017)==2071
# If no bigger number can be composed using those digits, return -1:
# nextBigger(9)==-1
# nextBigger(111)==-1
# nextBigger(531)==-1
#
def next_bigger(n)
  # your code
end
